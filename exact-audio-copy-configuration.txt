DESCRIPTION
	'Exact Audio Copy' settings for 'Test&Copy Image+CUE'-mode. We want to make clean and perfect rips. We use the 'Test&Copy Image+CUE'-mode because it is the only compliant way to restore the extracted data later to an identical audio CD as far as audio data and TOC is concerned. Splitting to singletracks, encoding to FLAC and tagging using the 'Musicbrainz' database is done later with more advanced tools that are designed for its specific purpose. 

SOFTWARE NEEDED
	Exact Audio Copy 1.0 beta 3 from www.exactaudiocopy.de
	
SETUP OPTIONS
	SELECT COMPONENTS TO INSTALL
		EAC = ON
		freedb Metadata Plugin = OFF
		GD3 Metadata Plugin = OFF
		CDRDAO = OFF
		FLAC = OFF
		AccurateRip = ON
		CTDB Plugin = OFF (See 'BUGS' for further information)

FIRST TIME WIZARD
	WELCOME
		(Nothing to select)

	CD-ROM SELECTION
		(Select the drives you want to use for ripping)

	EXTRACTION PREFERENCES
		I prefer to have accurate results = SELECTED

	FEATURE DETECTION
		(Nothing to select)

	(If your drive was found in EAC's drive feature database:)
		FEATURE DATABASE
			(Save the features listed under your drive's name)
			I don't trust these values, detect the features for my drive = SELECTED

				AUTODETECTION 
					(Insert any genuinely pressed audio CD (the more popular the title is the better) and wait until 'Configure AccurateRip' will popup. Click on CONFIGURE in the 'Configure AccurateRip' popup. Wait. 'AccurateRip' will popup with 'Congratulations, AccurateRip has been set up correctly'. Click 'OK'. If it is returns an error, abort and try with a different disc, then with a different drive.)
					(Let it detect everything)
					(Compare detected settings with the settings you saved before, if it doesn't match, try again with a different disc. Note that caching detection is not reliable. If you get mismatches with the settings you saved before repeatedly, go back and proceed with features from database. Read the 'Extraction Method'-section under 'Drive Options' in this manual carefully later)

				%albumartist% - %year% - %albumtitle%\%tracknr2% - %artist% - %title%
			Replace spaces by underscores = OFF

	DRIVE OPTIONS
	
		EXTRACTION METHOD
			Secure mode = SELECTED
				Drive has 'Accurate Stream' feature = Select according to your drive's specs
				Drive caches audio data = ON (This flushes the cache of your drive, otherwise rereading is useless, because it rereads from cache. To my experience it does not hurt to leave this always ON, even if your drive has no cache. Set to ON if detection during 'First Time Wizard' was unreliable)
				Drive is capable of retrieving C2 error information = OFF (Even if your drive is capable of retrieving C2 error information. Slows down the ripping process but it's not 100% safe to use this feature with EAC)

				Current = SELECTED
			Allow speed reduction during extraction = ON
			Use AccurateRip with this drive = ON

		GAP DETECTION

			Detection accuracy
				SECURE = SELECTED
