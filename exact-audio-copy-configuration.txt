DESCRIPTION
	Exact Audio Copy Settings for 'Test&Copy Image+CUE' mode. We want to make clean and perfect rips. We use the 'Test&Copy Image+CUE'-mode because it is the only compliant way to restore the extracted data later to an identical CDDA as far as audio data and TOC is concerned. Splitting to singletracks, encoding to FLAC and tagging with Musicbrainz is done later with more advanced tools that are designed for its specific purpose. 

SOFTWARE NEEDED
	Exact Audio Copy 1.0 beta 3 from www.exactaudiocopy.de
	
SETUP OPTIONS
	SELECT COMPONENTS TO INSTALL
		EAC = ON
		freedb Metadata Plugin = ON
		GD3 Metadata Plugin = OFF
		CDRDAO = OFF
		FLAC = OFF
		AccurateRip = ON
		CTDB Plugin = ON (Windows) / OFF (Wine, see BUGS for further information)

FIRST TIME WIZARD
	WELCOME
		(nothing to select)

	CD-ROM SELECTION
		(select the drives you want to use for ripping)

	EXTRACTION PREFERENCES
		I prefer to have accurate results = SELECTED

	FEATURE DETECTION
		(nothing to select)

	(if Drive was found in EACs drive feature database:)
		FEATURE DATABASE
			(save the features listed under your drive's name)
			I don't trust these values, detect the features for my drive = SELECTED

				AUTODETECTION 
					(let it detect everything)
					(Compare detected settings with the settings you saved before, if it doesn't match try again with a different Disc. Note that caching detection is not reliable. If only Caching detection mismatches repeatedly, proceed anyway. Read the 'Extraction Method'-section under 'Drive Options' in this manual carefully later)

				%albumartist% - %year% - %albumtitle%\%tracknr2% - %artist% - %title%

	DRIVE OPTIONS
	
		EXTRACTION METHOD
			Secure mode = SELECTED
				Drive has 'Accurate Stream' feature = Select according to your Drive's specs (
				Drive caches audio data = ON (this flushes the cache of your drive, otherwise rereading is useless, because it rereads from cache. To my experience it does not hurt to leave this always ON, even if your drive has no cache. Set to ON if detection during First Time Wizard was unreliable)
				Drive is capable of retrieving C2 error information = OFF (Even if your Drive is capable of retrieving C2 error information. Slows down the ripping process but it's not 100% safe to use this feature with EAC)

			Speed selection
				Current = SELECTED
			Allow speed reduction during extraction = ON
			Use Accuraterip with this drive = ON

		GAP DETECTION
			Gap/Index retrieval method = (you might need to change this individually for certain CDs if it freezes during detection. The method has nothing to do with its accuracy. The important thing is to set the following option right)
			Detection accuracy
				SECURE = SELECTED

		WRITER
